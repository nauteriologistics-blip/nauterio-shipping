# Cost Estimator Skill

Analyze and estimate AWS infrastructure costs for CDK projects using real-time pricing data from AWS.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-agent-skills-for-builders --skill cost-estimator
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Estimate costs for your CDK project in a specific region
python scripts/fetch-aws-pricing.py --region us-east-1

# Generate an Excel report with detailed cost breakdown
python scripts/generate-pricing-excel.py --input resources.json --output costs.xlsx
```

## Prerequisites

Before using this skill, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.8+** installed
- **AWS CDK project** with synthesizable stacks
- **Python packages**: `pandas`, `openpyxl`
- **AWS credentials** configured (for AWS Pricing API access)
- **Valid AWS regions** (standard regions or China regions: cn-north-1, cn-northwest-1)

```

## Common Tasks

### Estimate costs for a single region

```bash
python scripts/fetch-aws-pricing.py --region us-west-2
```

Output files will be saved to `cost-estimates/` directory:
- `cost-estimate-us-west-2.xlsx` - Detailed spreadsheet with formulas
- `cost-estimate-us-west-2.md` - Markdown summary for documentation

### Generate costs for multiple regions

Run the pricing script for each region:

```bash
for region in us-east-1 us-west-2 eu-west-1; do
  python scripts/fetch-aws-pricing.py --region $region
done
```

### Calculate Bedrock model costs

The skill includes Bedrock model pricing data. Reference `references/bedrock-pricing.md` for supported models and pricing structures.

## Output Files

Generated reports are saved to the `cost-estimates/` directory:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `cost-estimate-{region}.xlsx` | Comprehensive cost breakdown with per-resource costs |
| `cost-estimate-{region}.md` | Summary report for sharing and documentation |

## Supported AWS Regions

- **Standard Regions**: us-east-1, us-west-1, us-west-2, eu-west-1, eu-central-1, ap-southeast-1, ap-northeast-1, and all other public AWS regions
- **China Regions**: cn-north-1, cn-northwest-1 (with pricing in CNY)

## Troubleshooting

### AWS Credentials Not Found
Ensure your AWS credentials are configured:
```bash
aws configure
# or set AWS_PROFILE, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

### Python Dependencies Missing
Install required packages:
```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl
```

### No Resources Found
Verify your CDK project can be synthesized:
```bash
cdk synth
```
